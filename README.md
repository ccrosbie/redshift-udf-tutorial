# An Introduction to Python UDFs in Amazon Redshift with the CMS Open Payments Dataset
This is the code repository for samples  used the AWS Big Data blog An Introduction to Python UDFs in Amazon Redshift with the CMS Open Payments Dataset

##Overview of example

Amazon Redshift released a new feature that allows Python based User Defined Functions (UDFs) within an Amazon Redshift cluster. This post will serve as a tutorial to get you started using Python UDFs as a tool to accelerate and enhance your analysis as you explore the CMS Open Payments Dataset and make it so you never have to doubt your physician again.

other transfers of value,or ownership and investment interest in records reported in Open Payments. Each record includes the physicianâ€™s demographic information,specialties,and license information,as well as a unique identification number (Physician Profile ID) that can be used to search for a specific physician in the general,research,and physician ownership files.

##f_return_focused_specialty.sql
Example of a Python UDF which preforms a simple transform that returns the focused specialty of a physician. 

##f_return_general_specialty.sql
Example of a Python UDF which preforms a simple transform that returns the general specialty of a physician. 

##f_z_test_by_pval.sql
